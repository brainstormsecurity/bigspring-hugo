### The importance of using an experienced and professional ransomware negotiator.

Negotiating with an extortionist is not like haggling over the price in a shop or buying a car. In a real situation for a large business or corporation, it’s complex. There are a wide range of factors to consider, including whether to pay?
<br>
If you currently suffering a ransom demand, before acting on the demand, as part of your incident response, it’s absolutely imperative to think about negotiations and how these will take place within your company.
<br>
The primary objectives for ransomware negotiators is to learn, through experience, who the criminal organisation is, gather information and intelligence on their modus operandi (MO) and probe for further into the likelihood of data exfiltration, and deal with the de-escalate of threats or further damaging action being taken against the victim and; more importantly; lower the demand as far as possible without derailing the negotiation. 
<br>
A ransomware negotiator can help remove the emotion that is understandably felt, by the company or individual victim during an incident. This can help keep the negotiations professional and help you achieve your end goals.
<br>
How these objectives are achieved can vary from engagement to engagement, but it is imperative that the negotiator should gather and establish as much information as possible. Brainstorm Security secures this information and interactions with the bad actor on your behalf in a evidential format, so it can be used if required for any later court prosecutions.

<br>

### What should a ransomware negotiator quickly identify?

![image](../../images/hacker_ransomware.jpg)
<br>

1. **Monetary demands.** Our negotiators will quickly ascertain exactly how much the threat actor or group is really asking for rather than what they have initially demanded.

2.	**Government and regulatory sanctions checks.** It is imperative that sanction checks are completed thoroughly and properly documented before any ransom payments are made otherwise official action against the payee can be costly.  Brainstorm Security will help with this as part of its ransom negotiation service.

3. **Proof of exfiltration.** The negotiators will quickly ascertain whether the criminal group has a history of stealing data, and if the criminal group have published the stolen data regardless of what has been agreed

4.	**Confirm proof of decryption.** Otherwise known as ‘proof of life’. Our experienced negotiators will quickly ascertain whether the criminal group has actually stolen data from you and can actually decrypt data files identifying just how serious the threat in question really is.

5. **Threat escalation tactics.** Experienced negotiators will quickly ascertain whether threats of escalations in the demand, data leaks or imposition of stringent deadlines are likely. Any negotiation should be designed to make the situation better, not worse.

### The benefits of using a trusted ransomware negotiator. 

The main objective of a negotiator is to lower the ransom demand as far as possible and as quickly as possible but without derailing the negotiation. There are many methods that can lead to a successful outcome, negotiation tone, tactics, timing, messaging is all important. Good negotiators are highly skilled and experienced in what they do. Ransom claims must be expertly handled in order to reduce the level of the demand, minimise the risk of a ransom increase, data exfiltration, poor decryption outcome, follow on demands and exposure, sanction coverage and protection. 

<br>

Brainstorm Security does not encourage or recommend victim’s directly engage with cyber criminals or offer to pay a ransom demand. We will often encourage that the relevant police and authorities are notified. We can provide victims with a complete negotiation and resolution service which includes the facilitation of crypto for settlement of ransom demands, often during time critical situations.

<br>

Brainstorm Security provides a realistic assessment of any given situation, options and risks. We guide our clients through the negotiation and educate them on what to expect during negotiation so that our clients can make the best and most informed decision to enable a good outcome.
