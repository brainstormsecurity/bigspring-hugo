# Blackcat Ransomware: Is it still active?

The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang has shut down its servers in the midst of an allegation from an affiliate that they were scammed by the ransomware gang.

The affiliate claims that Blackcat/ALPHV stole $ millions in ransom money from them. Blackcat/ALPHV has obviously denied the accusation. This is amid claims that they scammed the affiliate responsible for the attack on Optum, the operator of the Change Healthcare platform, of $22 million.

# Rebranding? 

BlackCat is a rebrand of the previous ransomware operations DarkSide and BlackMatter. They have a history of shutting down and rebranding, so it is possible that this is just another chapter in their ongoing saga.

It is important to note that these are just allegations at this point, and there is no independent verification of the affiliate's claims. However, the shutdown of BlackCat's servers does suggest that there may be some truth to the allegations. Law Enforcement took down the leak blog site of Blackcat/ALPHV back in December 2023. The FBI announced that it had breached the ransomware gang's servers, monitored their activity, and obtained private decryption keys that helped more than 400 victims to recover their data for free.

ALPHV restored its infrastructure, though, and continued breaching companies and leaking data from victims that did not pay a ransom. 

# Law Enforcement Takedown. 

However, today the plot now thickens. An official Law Enforcement takedown notice has been placed on the ransomware gangs blog site on the dark web, indicating a further deliberate take down of the ransomware gang's infrastructure. The new site and the chat blog for negotiations to take place on, that is hosted on the TOR network have also been taken down.

At Brainstorm Security, we suspect that the Ransomware group has had some infighting among leaderships and the affiliates supporting the criminal venture, but as we saw only a week ago with the NCA (National Crime Agency and partners) takedown of the ransomware group Lockbit, law enforcement appears to be making a co-ordinated strike at large Ransomware as a service (Raas) gangs. This will make it very difficult for threat actors to extort money from victims in the near future. It will also be a wakeup call to anyone involved in ransomware as a criminal activity to think twice, as the police net starts to pull in all the threat actors involved, towards facing justice. 

If you are a victim of ransomware, it is important to report the attack to the authorities and to not pay the ransom if possible. Paying the ransom only emboldens the criminals and does not guarantee that you will get your files back. Brainstorm Security can assist individuals, companies and organisations with negotiation services to help reduce demands and increase the time limits set by threat actors.
