## Sharing After the Storm: Fostering Transparency in Post-Ransomware Response

Ransomware attacks are a harsh reality of the digital age. But what happens after the dust settles?  While the focus is rightfully on recovery, a crucial step often gets overlooked: Sharing Post Incident Response (PIR). This blog post, inspired by a talk given by Claire Patterson from the University of Kent, at the Impact Conference in London earlier this year, https://www.theimpactconference.com/impact-uk/delves into the complex world of information sharing following a cyber attack. 

**The Paradox of Transparency: Sharing vs Secrecy**

Companies face a dilemma -  should they be transparent about cyberattacks? Sharing valuable insights with peers can strengthen collective defences. However, legal concerns and reputational damage fears often lead to secrecy.

**Benefits of Sharing PIR Data**

* **Collective Defence:** Shared knowledge on attack vectors, malware strains, and attacker tactics equips everyone to better prepare.
* **Improved Response:** Learning from others' experiences can expedite response times and minimise downtime.
* **Trend Identification:** Recognising common attack patterns helps security professionals anticipate and pre-empt future threats.

**Downsides of Sharing PIR Data**

* **Legal Concerns:** Data breaches may trigger regulatory reporting requirements, and sharing sensitive information could complicate investigations.
* **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of a cyberattack can erode consumer trust and damage a company's image.
* **Internal Resistance:**  A culture of secrecy within an organisation might hinder information sharing within teams or with external parties.

**Fostering a Culture of Sharing**

Building a culture of information sharing necessitates a shift in mindset. Here are some key steps:

* **Clear Reporting Structures:** Establish well-defined protocols for reporting cyber incidents internally and to relevant authorities.
* **Regular Updates to Reporters:** Keep stakeholders informed throughout the incident response process and share post-mortem reports with insights.
* **I am a firm believer that the definition of integrity, is doing the right thing, even when no one is looking.**

**Who to Share With?**

Strategic information sharing is critical. Consider the following:

* **Trusted Peers:** Collaborate with industry partners who have faced similar attacks.
* **Suppliers:** Early engagement with critical suppliers ensures a coordinated response that minimises supply chain disruption, and can in fact build trust.

**Post-Incident Review: Learning from the Breach**

A thorough post-incident review is vital for effective PIR.  Key participants include:

* **C-Suite Executives:** Their involvement demonstrates leadership commitment to cybersecurity.
* **Security Teams:**  Sharing their experiences on the frontline helps identify areas for improvement.
* **Legal Teams:** Lessons learned how legal decisions can effect the wider response of a company.
* **Media Teams:** How was the incident managed and how can it be improved for internal and external communications.

**Identifying Themes and Learning Lessons**

The review should focus on identifying:

* **Themes:** Recurring patterns in the attack that highlight vulnerabilities in the existing security posture. 
* **Lessons Learned:** Actionable insights that can be translated into concrete steps to address identified risks and prevent future attacks. 

**Learning from the Wider Community: Insights from ICO Data**

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK collects data on cyber incidents. Analysing this data can reveal broader industry trends in cyberattacks and inform collective responses.

**Conclusion**

Sharing PIR data is a double-edged sword. While legal concerns are valid, the benefits of collective defence and improved preparedness outweigh the risks. By fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration, organisations can emerge from a ransomware attack stronger and better equipped to face future threats.

**Remember, knowledge is power. Sharing the right lessons learned from a cyberattack can empower the entire cybersecurity community to build a more resilient digital landscape.**
