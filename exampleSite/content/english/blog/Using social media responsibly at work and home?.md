#### Introduction

We should all be aware that we need to behave professionally online and are representing our companies we work for as ambassadors (even if we don’t know it), even when we have left work for the day or are posting online as a private individual.

That fact imposes obligations on us and our activity online. We should all be following the advice to secure our social media profiles and not making it obvious to criminals or threat actors what we do. This is not only a security issue but makes us all especially vulnerable to our posts being seen by the public and thus affecting how they perceive the organisation you work for. Just one negative interaction or experience of the organisation will form the basis of how a person feels about that Business, Government department or Organisation.


### Its ok. My accounts are locked down and nobody can see.

Even if you think your account is locked down and people cannot see that you are an employee of a company with sensitive data or objectives, most of the time it is not difficult to work it out. Your friends list (lots of other employees) liked groups or retweets, posts relevant to your organisation (e.g thin blue line images for the police) are just three of many indications around what you do for a living and which can be found fairly easily.

### What goes on tour stays on tour....or does it?

Unlike something said in conversation, online activity is there for a very long time, if not forever. Something posted, followed or liked without thought can have huge implications. It can affect how the people we deal with view the organisation you work for. For example, if a police officer publicly posted negative views about immigration, would you feel less confident in reporting a crime if you were an ethnic minority?

In that case you may be stating that opinion as a private person, but would a member of the public see that distinction? You should behave online as you would do offline.


### What is safe to post on social media then?

The test for what is appropriate is simple: you should not post anything online which could bring the company or organisation into disrepute, or you would not be happy saying to a member of the public face-to-face. If in doubt, don't write it. Before you post, just pause a minute and think about what you've written. 

A number of recent high-profile investigations looking at misconduct in public office have involved the use of WhatsApp or similar group messaging apps. Many teams have a group chat set-up which can be useful and valuable. It is not open to wider public view in the way that Facebook, Twitter and other platforms are.

You may feel that as WhatsApp is encrypted, it is safe to send messages and include private information on there. It isn't that simple. Not only do phones and devices store these messages, but how do you know that other people in the chat group won't be more liberal in sharing your comments?

### We should not be posting inappropriate or offensive content.

We should not be posting inappropriate or offensive content, using discriminatory language, or including private information about members of your company, organisation, the public or operationally sensitive material. 

What can be written and sent in seconds could come back to haunt you — if in any doubt do not send it. If you receive a message or content from colleagues that is offensive or discriminatory, you have an obligation to report it. Do not send or be involved in receiving such material. If you do, your job could be at risk.

### Conclusion

Social media can be very useful in promoting brands, organisations, raising awareness as to what you are doing. It can also be fun and enjoyable. 

Please have fun and just think before posting!
