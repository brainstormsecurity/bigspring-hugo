Have you planned for what will happen if you or your organisation is struck with a ransomware demand? You may need to contact a number of people to assist including Law Enforcement, ICO, an Incident Response company ......and maybe a Ransomware negotiator?

### Ransomware negotiating services as part of your cybersecurity incident response plan?

The Financial Times published a recent article about negotiating with hackers after a cyber attack. It discusses the challenges of ransomware attacks and the reasons why companies pay the ransom. The author suggests that companies should have a plan in place to deal with hackers and that negotiation can be an effective way to recover data. We would agree with having a plan, and having a negotiator as part of that plan should the worst happen. It is important to weigh the costs of paying the ransom against other options. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to pay is up to the victim, but an experienced negotiator can help provide time, intelligence, an understanding of how the attack occured, and much  more than just a reduced demand amount.
