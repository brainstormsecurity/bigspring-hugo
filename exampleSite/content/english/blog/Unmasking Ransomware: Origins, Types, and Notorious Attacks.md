# Introduction:

Ransomware, a malicious software that encrypts a victim's files or
entire computer system and demands payment for their release, has become
a pervasive and formidable threat in the digital age. Brainstorm Security 
are used to helping victims, negotiate with ransomware threat actors to help resolve situations positivily.
In this article, we will delve into the origins of ransomware, its evolving types, and
highlight some high-profile attacks that have shaken industries worldwide.

# Origins of Ransomware:

1\. Early Instances:

The roots of ransomware can be traced back to the late 1980s. The AIDS
Trojan, one of the earliest instances, spread via floppy disks and
demanded payment through snail mail. However, these early versions
lacked the sophistication seen in contemporary attacks.

2\. Encryption Advances:

The modern era of ransomware emerged in the mid-2000s with the advent of
advanced encryption algorithms. Cybercriminals began exploiting these
technologies to effectively lock victims out of their files or systems.

# 

# Various Types of Ransomware:

1\. Encrypting Ransomware:

This type encrypts files on the victim\'s system, rendering them
inaccessible until a ransom is paid. Cryptolocker is a notable example
that emerged in 2013, targeting Windows users.

2\. Locker Ransomware:

Rather than encrypting files, locker ransomware locks the victim out of
their entire device, making it unusable. Notable examples include
WinLocker and Police-themed ransomware.

3\. Scareware:

This deceptive form of ransomware convinces users that their system is
infected, demanding payment for fake antivirus software or services.
Examples include the infamous \"FBI\" or \"Police\" ransomware.

4\. Doxware or Leakware:

This variant not only encrypts files but threatens to release sensitive
information unless a ransom is paid. Sodinokibi (REvil) is a notorious
strain that gained prominence for its data exfiltration capabilities.

# High-Profile Ransomware Attacks:

**1. WannaCry (2017):**

WannaCry targeted Windows systems globally, exploiting a vulnerability
in the operating system. It affected major organizations, including the
NHS in the UK, disrupting critical services and underscoring the
potential impact of ransomware on public infrastructure.

**2. NotPetya (2017):**

Initially disguised as ransomware, NotPetya was later revealed to be a
wiper designed to cause widespread destruction. It affected numerous
businesses, including Maersk and Merck, causing billions in damages.

**3. Colonial Pipeline (2021):**

Highlighting the impact on critical infrastructure, the Colonial
Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted fuel supplies on the U.S. East
Coast. The DarkSide group claimed responsibility, sparking debates about
the vulnerabilities of crucial systems. A large payment of
cryptocurrency was made to the threat actors, with authorities managing
to recover (under a shroud of privacy) a substantial amount of
cryprocurrency, post incident.

**4. JBS Foods (2021):**

Affecting one of the world\'s largest meat processors, the JBS Foods
ransomware attack disrupted global meat supply chains. REvil, the
ransomware-as-a-service group, claimed responsibility.

**5. Royal Mail (2023):**

Royal Mail's international shipping of parcels and letters through its
post office branches came to a standstill. The attackers, the LockBit
ransomware gang linked to Russia, demanded a huge ransom payment in
exchange for the decryption key. The negotiation logs were leaked by the
ransomware gang, giving some insight into one companies ransomware
negotiation dilemma.

# Conclusion:

Ransomware continues to evolve, posing significant threats to
individuals, businesses, and even critical infrastructure. Understanding
its origins, various types, and learning from high-profile attacks is
crucial for developing effective cybersecurity strategies to combat this
ever-growing menace. As the digital landscape evolves, vigilance, robust
cybersecurity measures, and a proactive stance are essential to
safeguard against the potentially devastating consequences of ransomware
attacks.

When responding to an incident of ransomware, knowing your enemy, gives
a better understanding, to the chances of negotiation working well, and
provides vital intelligence on how the threat actors have operated
previously.
