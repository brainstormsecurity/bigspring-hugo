### Looking for a reason to join at Trade Body?
Not sure if you should join a trade or industry association as part of your career path or to help your business? We have provided 8 reason to consider when thing about joining an organisation to represent you. My company is focused on security and trust, but these reasons may cross over into nearly all industries. 



{{< youtube _CF8r_5NTDQ >}} 

### 1. Resources for Education
A trade association focused specifically on the security industry offers one place to get industry resources and professional development materials. You will find help to access online articles and trade publications and brings you the most relevant news and insights for improving your business.

<br>

### 2. Legislative Representation
Chances are, while you’re running your business, you don’t have time (or adequate resources) to advocate for legislation on behalf of your business or as an individual worker in that industry. Joining an association empowers you with representation by a group with the same interests, advocating for all the security industries. Your business succeeds when your industry succeeds.

<br>

### 3. Cost Savings
One of the most tangible trade association benefits is saving money on professional advice. But in joining a security association, you may benefit from other discounts such as lower insurance and benefit premiums, all the while, investing back into your industry.


<br>

### 4. Industry News and Research
By pooling resources, a trade association is able to investigate industry news and conduct research that members can access. Members stay on top of the changes in security regulation and compliance, and give smaller businesses and consultants a more powerful voice, challenging the industry.

<br>

### 5. Network of Industry Leaders
A trade association offers valuable industry networking. It’s important to have contacts in your field and a network of leaders in businesses that are similar to yours. With the insider benefits gained in your trade association, you are set to become an industry leader yourself, thereby growing your reputation and your business.


<br>

### 6. A Unique group of Professionals
You will become part of a unique group of high quality and professional companies which are well-respected and well-represented helping to provide influence to government, end users, specifiers, standards and legislative bodies.


<br>

### 7. International Networking and Understanding
Being part of a security trade association that is international at its foundations, will help connect security professionals from all over the world. They can share best practice, connect to work on joint projects, around the world. Provide a deeper and better cultural understanding of other countries, and possible pitfalls in working in unfamiliar countries, by speaking with other members of the association.


<br>

### 8. Inside Opportunities
Do you ever wonder how people get in on the best and latest opportunities? And why you always hear about them after the fact? An industry association can help you bridge that gap. Associations often sponsor sub-groups of people who collaborate with each other on specific projects. When people get to know you through an association, you will also be first on their list to contact when they have a new idea and need some help. Because people come to industry associations from a broad range of interests, you might have access to opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise. You might hear of situations you’ve never even thought to explore, and there may be an opening for you to participate.


### What do you do?
