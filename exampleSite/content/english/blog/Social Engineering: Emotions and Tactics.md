## Social Engineering: Emotions and Tactics

Here at Brainstorm Security, we use social engineering all the time to conduct physical penetration tests, phishing simulations, ransomware negotiations and even who's turn it is to make the coffee! Social engineering can be a manipulative technique that exploits human emotions and vulnerabilities to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, granting access to systems, or taking actions against their best interests. We like to use it in a positive manner, so people are left with a positive feeling after an interaction. In an eduction setting people don't like to feel they have been 'tricked'. The learning comes from exposing employees to the emotion, and getting them to recognise just how a bad guy can use this to manipulate (and ultimately gain unauthorised access to premises/systems/money). The practice of social engineering targets emotions like:

* **Fear:** Scammers may impersonate authority figures, threaten legal consequences, or fabricate urgent situations to pressure victims into compliance.
* **Greed:** The promise of quick riches, exclusive deals, or inheritance scams can lure individuals into disclosing financial information or clicking on malicious links.
* **Curiosity:** Phishing emails or intriguing messages designed to pique interest can encourage users to open attachments or visit compromised websites.
* **Helpfulness:** Pretending to need assistance or posing as a charity can manipulate individuals into sharing personal details or donating to fraudulent causes.

Social engineers employ various tactics to manipulate these emotions, including:

* **Impersonation:** Scammers often pose as legitimate entities like banks, tech support, or government officials to lend credibility to their requests.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of time pressure can cloud judgment and lead victims to act impulsively without proper verification.
* **Scarcity:** Highlighting limited-time offers or exclusive opportunities can trigger a fear of missing out and prompt hasty decisions.
* **Reciprocity:** Exploiting feelings of obligation or indebtedness can trick individuals into returning favors or granting requests, even if suspicious.
* **Liking:** Building rapport and establishing trust through flattery or friendly communication can lower victim defenses and make them more susceptible to manipulation.


Remember, staying vigilant and practicing healthy skepticism are crucial steps in mitigating the risk of social engineering attacks. Never share personal information or grant access without verifying the sender's legitimacy, and be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. If you suspect an attempt, report it to the appropriate authorities and seek help from security professionals.
