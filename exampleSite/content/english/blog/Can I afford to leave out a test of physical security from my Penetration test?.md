### Can I afford to leave out a test of physical security from my Penetration test?

#### Introduction

In a world where cybersecurity has become such an important part of any organization, it is easy to forget the importance of protecting your physical assets. We often see organizations adopting a haphazard approach to the testing and protection of their facilities and equipment. There are many reasons why this happens; however, they all result in there being significant holes in their overall security strategy. You might just be wanting to test your current security team to ensure you are getting the best return on investment (ROI).

### Physical security testing is often times the most overlooked aspect of a penetration test.

Physical security testing is often the most overlooked aspect of a penetration test. Commonly, it's because physical security testing is expensive to do and takes more time than other tests, but that doesn't mean you should forget about it! Physical security testing is essential to ensure that hackers can't get into your building through any door or window they want.

Physical Security Testing provides you with insight into how well your facility will be able to protect against theft and whether or not there are vulnerabilities in its structure. This information will help inform investing decisions in order to make sure that every dollar spent on physical protection systems pays off as expected.

### Threats are constantly evolving, and physical security should be tested against more than just an active threat.

The threats you'll face are constantly evolving, and physical security should be tested against more than just an active threat.

You should also test your physical security against passive threats (someone sneaking in after hours, for example), as well as insider threats (an employee with malicious intent).

### Physical security is an often overlooked aspect of cybersecurity, which can be devastating to your company.

Leaving out a test of physical security from your penetration test can have devastating consequences. Physical security is just as important to cybersecurity as network cybersecurity, and can be more devastating than cyber security attacks in the long run. Many people do not realize this because physical security threats are less visible than their digital counterparts.

The best way to understand why you need to include physical security testing in your penetration test is by looking at the most common threat vectors:

* Social engineering (phishing/social media) - This type of attack relies on human interaction and requires social skills that machines do not possess. They rely on human error or carelessness to succeed--something which machines cannot emulate successfully without extensive training; however, they can certainly automate some aspects of social engineering such as phishing emails or other messaging campaigns.

* Physical access - It's easier for someone with physical access inside your building (or even outside!) than through any other means mentioned here thus far because they can see what's happening inside from anywhere!

### The 3 types of threats you have to look out for.

* An active threat is a person who wants to access your network. A passive threat is someone who's just trying to get information from you.

* An insider threat could be anyone in the company, including employees, contractors and third-party vendors.

* Threats are constantly evolving and the physical security should be tested against more than just an active threat (which is what most pen tests focus on).

The main difference between passive threats and insiders has to do with intent: insiders are typically loyal people working for you who may have malicious intentions but aren't necessarily aware that they're working against their employer's best interests; whereas a passive attacker doesn't care about loyalty at all—they just want access to data so they can sell it or use it themselves.

### Active Threats: Active threats are generally easier to defend against, as they are less subtle and typically can’t cause as much damage.

Active threats represent an active attack and are generally easier to defend against because they are less subtle and typically can’t cause as much damage. In fact, many security controls like firewalls and intrusion detection systems were designed to protect against these types of attacks. Taking an active approach to your penetration test allows you to discover any vulnerabilities that may exist in your network from these types of threats.

The advantage of an active test is that it allows you to identify potential issues with your security measures before they occur. A disadvantage is that if something goes wrong during the testing process, such as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack or other form of cyberattack, it might be harder for us to determine whether or not we were successful at finding all the flaws in your system’s defences than if we had done a passive approach first where nothing happens until after everything has been tested passively first.

The threat may not be activity looking to steal data, but maybe an activist group opposed to your company ethos and policies. The threat maybe from opportunist criminals or an organised crime group (OCG), looking to steal items of high net worth, or kidnap members of the family.

### Passive Threats: Passive threats usually go undetected unless there is a thorough testing process in place. This type of threat is pervasive and often does the most damage because of it.

Passive threats are often overlooked, but they can cause the most damage. This is because passive threats are more pervasive than active threats, and therefore harder to detect. Passive threats are also harder to defend against because they often go undetected until it's too late.

### The Insider Threat.

This is a problem, and it’s going to get worse. Insider threats – employees who abuse their access to sensitive data and systems for malicious purposes – are a growing threat in an age where every company is becoming interconnected through cloud computing. According to Verizon's 2019 Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR), insider-caused data breaches have become more frequent over time. In fact, they were responsible for more than half of all incidents in 2019 (55%).

* The reasons why insiders are becoming such a big problem include:

* They're more likely trusted by the organization;

* They have access to sensitive data;

* They may be motivated by revenge or greed; and/or

* The damage they can cause is often greater than what external attackers might cause

* While insider threats are harder to defend against, they are not impossible.

### While insider threats are harder to defend against, they are not impossible. In fact, we can help you build an effective physical security testing strategy that will provide your company with the best possible defence against insider threats.

Physical security testing should be done continuously and by a third party so that both you and your team can learn from it. Your team may have their own ideas about what works and what doesn't, but without knowing what problems exist physically in your environment, those ideas will be based on speculation rather than proven facts - which means they could end up missing critical vulnerabilities in your business model or technology stack.

We recommend running regular assessments from outside experts who know more than just one thing about information security; this includes not only penetration testers, but also threat intelligence analysts and risk management professionals (among others).

### Protecting your facilities requires continuous testing and evaluation.

If you take the time to do a thorough and comprehensive penetration test, you will improve your overall security posture. This can be done by combining different tests, including physical security testing, in order to get a more complete picture of your company's vulnerabilities. By only conducting penetration tests in the digital realm or by hiring an outside contractor for your physical security assessments, you may not fully understand how vulnerable your organization really is nor have taken necessary steps towards improving it.

Physical security testing should be done regularly because even if nothing has happened recently that would require an upgrade or repair (such as theft), new threats could develop at any time that would require these changes now while they're still possible rather than later when they might already be too late. Additionally, since the threat landscape constantly changes with new technologies emerging every day along with new techniques being developed by hackers worldwide who are constantly working on finding ways around existing protections - it is important to continue updating defences as needed so that they stay relevant through all phases of life cycle management (Lifecycle Management).

Finally - because there are many different types

of companies out there—each having their own unique needs and requirements—you should always make sure that whoever provides services such as these, has experience specifically within their industry sector before working with them."

### Conclusion

In today’s world of hackers, malware and other digital threats, there is no doubt that physical security testing should be a part of any organization’s cybersecurity program. It is the most overlooked aspect of a penetration test and can leave your company vulnerable to an active or passive threat. While it can be difficult to defend against insider threats, they are not impossible.
