**The Threat Landscape: Ransomware on the Rise**

Ransomware attacks are a constant threat, causing havoc for businesses and organisations of all sizes. The decision of whether or not to negotiate with cybercriminals throws many into a difficult dilemma. Fear of encouraging further attacks clashes with the need to recover critical data.

In my session, "Navigating the Ransomware Negotiation Dilemma," I'll be delving into the complexities of this critical decision. We'll explore:

* The different negotiation strategies available
* The pros and cons of each approach
* Key considerations for achieving the best possible outcome during a ransomware incident

This session is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate this challenging scenario. Whether you're a Company Director, Board member, seasoned security professional or just starting out, this talk will provide valuable insights to help you protect your organisation.
