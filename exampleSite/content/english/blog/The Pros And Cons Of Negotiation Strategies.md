{{< youtube LBsXiyqjPmM&t >}}

I hope you enjoy.

**The Threat Landscape: Ransomware on the Rise**

Ransomware attacks are a constant threat, causing havoc for businesses and organisations of all sizes. The decision of whether or not to negotiate with cybercriminals throws many into a difficult dilemma. Fear of encouraging further attacks clashes with the need to recover critical data.

**Navigating the Negotiation Maze: My Talk at BSides Exeter**

In my session, "Navigating the Ransomware Negotiation Dilemma," I'll be delving into the complexities of this critical decision. We'll explore:

* The different negotiation strategies available
* The pros and cons of each approach
* Key considerations for achieving the best possible outcome during a ransomware incident

This session is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate this challenging scenario. Whether you're a Company Director, Board member, seasoned security professional or just starting out, this talk will provide valuable insights to help you protect your organisation.

**Beyond My Session: A Day of Security Exploration**

BSides Exeter isn't just about one talk! This community-driven conference offers a full day of learning and networking opportunities. Expect a lineup of engaging talks, workshops, and hacking villages covering a wide range of cybersecurity topics.
