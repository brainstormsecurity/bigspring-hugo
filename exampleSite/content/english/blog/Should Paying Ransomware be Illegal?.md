# The Rising Ransomware Threat Fuels Debate on Payment Ban

As cybercrime threat actors continue to rake in profits for attackers, the discussion surrounding a federal ban on ransom payments in the US is growing increasingly heated.

For years, US officials have advised against succumbing to ransom demands. However, despite several states like North Carolina and Florida implementing bans on such payments for local governments, the Biden administration opted against a national ban in 2022. Now Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, has also waded into the debate having drawn a parallel with paying terrorist kidnappers.

There is no ban in the UK, USA or most other countries around the world regarding paying hackers and faced with a crisis, about 58 per cent of businesses pay up, according to a survey by the company Proofpoint. British companies were even more likely to hand over the ransom (82 per cent). Mainly because payments are often covered by insurance.

The reasons for this are multifaceted. Implementing and enforcing such a ban would be complex, requiring mechanisms that aren't currently in place. Critics also argue that criminalising payments could penalise victims, potentially facing legal consequences for protecting their businesses or, in critical cases, potentially saving lives.

However, a potential shift in the US government's stance may be underway. In October 2023, a US-led international alliance committed to not paying ransoms, aiming to starve cybercriminals of their income stream. In 2023 the UK increased its government efforts in the fight against ransomware, with the increased use of sanctions and other efforts [UK Government blog post on the crackdown](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-cracks-down-on-ransomware-actors "UK .GOV blog post on Ransomware crackdown") but political pressure is also mounting, in finding a solution to protect UK companies and industry from this criminal menace.

This pledge from governments coincides with a surge in ransomware activity. 2024 alone witnessed:

* Widespread exploitation of vulnerabilities in remote access tools by financially motivated hackers to deploy ransomware.
* Notorious ransomware groups bouncing back from government actions.
* Disruptions in healthcare due to a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare.

## Is a Ban on Ransomware Payments the Answer?

The solution isn't as simple as a ban.

On the surface, it seems logical. If paying ransoms is illegal, attackers lose their financial incentive, potentially pushing them to target elsewhere and reducing attacks overall.

However, many argue that such a ban is an oversimplification:

* Global Problem: Ransomware is a global issue. A successful ban would require international co-operation and consistent regulations across varying national legal frameworks, a near-impossible feat.

* Safe Harbor Concerns: Countries like Russia, known havens for cybercriminals, would need to crack down internally, which they are unlikely to do.

* Exceptions and Their Dilemmas: Even a ban would likely require exceptions in dire situations, such as healthcare emergencies or threats to critical infrastructure. These exceptions, while necessary, could be exploited by attackers targeting such sectors. As bad as it sounds, if ransomware gangs know they can get a big payout from attacking hospitals or critical infrastructure, they will target these industries as they are criminals motivated in the main, by greed and money.

* Reduced Reporting: Some argue a ban could discourage victims from reporting incidents, hindering collaboration between victims and law enforcement.

* Limited Effectiveness: Data from North Carolina and Florida in America, which implemented bans on public entities paying ransoms, shows no significant decrease in reported attacks, hinting at the limited effectiveness of such measures.

* Underground Economy: Banning payments could push the market underground, making it more challenging to track and potentially leading to more sophisticated attack strategies.

## Complexities Remain

While many experts agree that paying ransoms ultimately harms society, they also acknowledge the limitations of a ban as a sole solution. Further research is needed to explore alternative strategies and their potential effectiveness before making informed decisions.

**The debate continues**, with no easy answers in sight. As the ransomware threat evolves, finding a comprehensive approach to combatting this growing menace remains a complex challenge.
