#### EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE BACKUP
External hard drive backups are still quite popular. Please note that you do not use a good backup method if you then keep the physical backup at home or on the same PC. Safe storage of an external hard drive is important.

External hard drives are mainly used for data storage and PC backups. The biggest disadvantage of an external hard drive is that the hard drive can break down or get lost. Physical external hard drives are often not handled with care or they are collecting dust for too long. The biggest advantage is that the storage space only needs to be purchased once. It is also a nice addition to a cloud or online backup. Don’t forget to update your physical hard drive every year.

An external hard drive is usually available at web shops that sell other electrical hardware. You can purchase external hard drives from e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com and BestBuy.
