  title : "About Us<br>  <br> Why was Brainstorm Security founded?"
  image : "images/passion.jpg"
  content : "The founder Richard had always wanted to be a police officer, ever since being a little boy. He grew up and took on a number of diffrent jobs from office equipment sales, to working for local govenment. A year or so before the 'DotCom boom' of the late 80s, and having a life long interest in computers, he was offered two different jobs as a computer programmer. However, he passed up on these amazing opportunities to earn an extra £30 a week 'beer money' working in an office. As we grow up we can all look back and consider 'what if?' in our life choices.
  
  <br>
  
  Richard travelled and worked abroad, returning to join the police in the UK. He enjoyed an amazing career for nearly three decades. He worked in forward facing uniformed police roles, dealing with people from all parts of society, from the homeless to high society, which gave him an amazing experience of communicating with people. He mastered his skills of dealing with incidents under pressure, and with people often in crisis, victims, offenders, witnesses and everyone else associated with the criminal justice system. Many critical incidents would often involve 'life or death' decision making. He took this in his stride, following the core policing principles, protecting life and property, preserving order, preventing the commission of offences, bringing offenders to justice."

      content : "A successful social engineering testing programme has well defined objectives and covers several approaches. These include remote digital techniques including leveraging email, text message, phone call and even post. For complete coverage, in person techniques that achieve physical access should also be conducted. When all these approaches are included in a social engineering test, a true picture of strengths and weaknesses, as relates to people, begins to emerge."
