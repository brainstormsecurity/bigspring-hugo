  title : "About Us<br>  <br> Why was Brainstorm Security founded?"
  image : "images/passion.jpg"
  content : "Hello, my name is Richard, and I am the founder of Brainstorm Security Ltd. This is a shortened version of my life and journey in how I created this company.
I had always wanted to be a police officer, ever since being a little boy. I grew up and took on a number of different jobs, from office equipment sales, to working for local government. A year or so before the ‘Dot-com boom’ of the late 80s, and having a lifelong interest in computers, I was offered two different jobs as a computer programmer. However, I passed up on these amazing opportunities to earn an extra £30 a week ‘beer money’ working in an office. As we grow up, we can all look back and consider ‘what if?’ in our life choices.  <br/>  I travelled and worked abroad, returning to join the police in the UK. There I enjoyed an amazing career for nearly three decades. I worked in public facing uniformed police roles. I would walk the beat while checking if doors were locked on commercial premises in the middle of the night. I had exposure to people from all parts of society, from the homeless to high society, which gave me an amazing experience of communicating with people. Furthermore, I mastered my skills of dealing with incidents under pressure, and with people often in crisis, victims, offenders, witnesses and everyone else associated with the criminal justice system. Many critical incidents would often involve ‘life or death’ decision-making. I took this in my stride, following the core policing principles, protecting life and property, preserving order, preventing the commission of offences and bringing offenders to justice."

      content : "Often working in a small team, it would sometimes feel like the ‘A’ team. Our 80’s TV heroes motto was, ‘If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them.... maybe you can hire the A-Team.’ We would often get asked for ideas and strategies how to catch some of the most dangerous and clever criminals. We would come up with a plan, put it into action and successfully bring to justice, the ‘Mr Bigs’ of the criminal underworld. (Except we would not use any Gaffer tape or build a tank in deploying our plans, unlike the real ‘A’ team)."

      content : "My career has enabled me to obtain a broad and secure skills base, including OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence Gathering), Social Engineering and HUMINT (Human Intelligence). I have gained a large amount of experience planning and conducting highly successful physical penetration tests on some very secure government premises. My physical penetration testing experience has also included large scale music and sporting events. Some events have had VIP and key dignitaries attending with their own armed security details. As a qualified trainer and assessor, I have trained many ‘police only’ courses and have been a subject matter expert, delivering lessons at the College of Policing. <Br/> Some of my key achievements include, representing my organisation when supporting and training an international police force. Working with other UK Government agencies and other international law enforcement agencies on active investigations. Creating and leading one of the UKs most effective, specialist online investigation teams to bring to justice many cyber criminals and child sex offenders.
