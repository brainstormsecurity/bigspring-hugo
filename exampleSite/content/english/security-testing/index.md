## Social Engineering & Physical Security Testing

<br>

### Why do I need to test my physical security?

<br>

You spend a lot of money on security. This will involve the physical security of your buildings and facilities. You may have high security fencing, deadbolt door locks, CCTV cameras, intrusion detection systems, alarms, security guards, patrol dogs, HID entry cards, encrypton of data, ID badges, biometric entry systems to name but a few security options. Your current security maybe providing the best security for you, your family or your business assets. All of these can be very good at protecting what is important to you, **but are you really protected?** Often the weakest link is the human factor. The staff member who could be taken in by a confidence trickster to gain access to your facility. Maybe the offender will just trick the staff member to transfer your money to another account controlled by the offenders? 

<br>

### Have you ever tested your security systems and protocols to see if they really work? 

<br>

We have the knowledge and experience of decades in polcing, walking the streets at night checking if doors are closed and locked, attending real life crime scences, knowing how real criminals operate and the (MO) modus operandi criminals use. We have direct experence of dealing with human intelligence sources and speaking with criminals and bad actors as to how and why they would attack your assets. How offenders negotiate in kidnaps and randsomware incidents.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

##### Blockquote

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
